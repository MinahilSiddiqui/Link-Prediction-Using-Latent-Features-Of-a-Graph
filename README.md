# Link Prediction Using Latent Features of a Graph

This project explores the application of traditional and novel methods for link prediction in graphs. By utilizing Python, we have implemented various link prediction algorithms and machine learning models to build a powerful recommender system. The system is designed to predict potential connections (links) between nodes in a graph using latent features and majority voting techniques.

## **Project Structure**
![Methodology Diagram](methodology.png)
The methodology follows three key phases:

### **1. Data Gathering Approach**

* **Graph Data**: Collected graph data representing nodes and edges.
* **SNAP**: Processed graph data using the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) library.
* **Node and Edge Sampling**: Generated positive and negative samples from nodes and edges for training.

### **2. Traditional Methods Implementation**

* **Methods Applied**:

  * Common Neighbors
  * Preferential Attachment
  * Jaccard's Coefficient
  * Adamic Adar
  * Resource Allocation
* **Machine Learning Models**: Used Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest for training and evaluation.
* **Best Performing Features**:

  * **Common Neighbors up to 2 hops** provided the most accurate results.
  * Adamic Adar also showed strong performance.

### **3. New Proposed Method**

* Introduced a **majority voting mechanism** for better link prediction accuracy:

  * Combined outputs of models like ANN, XGBoost, and Decision Tree.
  * Ensured high accuracy by leveraging multiple classifiers.
* Visualization tools were used to analyze and present results effectively.

### **Recommender System**

The final outcome of the project is a recommender system that:

* Accurately predicts links based on graph latent features.
* Combines results from various ML classifiers into a unified prediction.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * **Graph Processing**: SNAP
  * **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras
  * **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## **Features**

* Comparison of traditional methods vs. a novel majority voting approach.
* Implementation of multiple machine learning classifiers.
* Comprehensive data visualization for insights.

## **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

4. Explore the visualizations and predictions generated by the system.

## **Results**

* Traditional methods like Common Neighbors and Adamic Adar perform well.
* The new proposed method with majority voting achieves superior accuracy and robustness.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the potential of combining latent graph features and machine learning models to solve link prediction problems effectively. The novel majority voting method outperforms traditional techniques and provides an accurate foundation for building graph-based recommender systems.
